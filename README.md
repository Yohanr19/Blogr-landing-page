## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript 

### What I learned

I din't learned any new trick or method, but i got more practice whit the flex-box / grid displays and also got more practice whit JavaScript and Dom-Manipulation. 

### Continued development
I want to learn how to deploy interactive menus in a more fluid manner, right now i think my menu display is very forced and i needed to make a lot of tweaking in order to make it look like the example. I want to practice to make that kind of interactive layout more quickly and consise. 
### Useful resources
- [Mozilla Dev Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) - Helps me to get responsive desings working, the tools used is the Responsive Desing Mode (Crtl+shift+M), plus the rest of the tools of mozilla dev browser.
- [Mozilla Web Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Used for docummentation, i think it is esential to always check the official documentacion incase you get stuck.
